## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

Working with Vue and tailwindcss. Some basic flexbox styling. Had to fiddle around with the background image for quite a while, getting it to render the way it's shown in the design layout on both mobile and desktop views.

### Continued development

Definitely plan on using tailwindcss more, it's very nice for quick styling. Want to do more with Vue as well.

### Useful resources

Mostly just reading through the official docs of Vue and tailwind helped me the most.
